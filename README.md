# Chat with LLAMA-2

This library includes some very simple utils to load LLAMA-2 from huggingface into a note book and chat with it.
You can also load any of the LLAMA-models via the load_model function.

## Installation

All the requirements to be installed are at the top of the notebook. We recommend using a fresh conda environment.
